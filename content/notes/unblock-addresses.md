`rampart:unban()` without an address unbans the connected client address in the following resolution order:

|   |   |
|---|---|
| ENV | `APNSCP_CLIENT_IP` |
| HTTP | `X-Forwarded-For` (requires [core] => http_trusted_forward) |
| HTTP | `REMOTE_ADDR` |
| ENV | `SSH_CLIENT` |

```bash
# Check self is banned
cpcmd rampart:is-banned
# Unban self
cpcmd rampart:unban
# Get ban reason from fail2ban
cpcmd rampart:get-reason
```
All commands above can be also run against a specific IP e.g. `cpcmd rampart:is-banned 1.2.3.4`.

Problem fat-fingering passwords + dynamic IP? Use `cp.whitelist-access true` to always permit panel access even if banned. Only `rampart:blacklist` has precedence when set.
